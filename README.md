# HTTPM

HTTPM is an HTTP server and web framework implemented using the [M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS) language.  It is being developped and tested using [GT.M](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/).

## Configuring it

See conf/httpm.conf and modify it to suits your needs.  Better yet, copy, modify, and pass the new file as the second argument to httpm.sh.

## Starting the server

Start the server by executing `./script/httpm.sh start <configuration file>`.

## Stoping the server

Stop the server by executing `./script/httpm.sh stop <configuration file>`.
