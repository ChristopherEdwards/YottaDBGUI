HTTP server developed using GT.M.

The following globals are required (some configuration utility will goes in eventually).
^httpm("conf","root")		:	Fullpath to documents (like Apache's Docroot).
^httpm("conf","index")		:	Default file name if a path is requested (you probably want index.html).
^httpm("conf","listen")		:	Port to listen on.
^httpm("conf","host")		:	Server's hostname (or virtual hostname).
^httpm("conf","timezone")	:	Server's timezone.

To run :
Execute conf^httpm once, than start the server by calling start^httpm.
