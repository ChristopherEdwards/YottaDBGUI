HTTP server developed using GT.M.

The following globals are required (some configuration utility will goes in eventually).
^httpm("conf","root")		:	Fullpath to document root.  Example : "/var/www/localhost/htdocs/"
^httpm("conf","index")		:	Default file name if a path is requested.  Example : "index.html"
^httpm("conf","listen")		:	Port to listen on.  Example : 8080
^httpm("conf","host")		:	Server's hostname (or virtual hostname).  Example : "localhost"
^httpm("conf","timezone")	:	Server's timezone.  Example : "EDT"

Initial internal configuration (needed only once) :
$gtm_dist/mumps -run conf^httpm

Start the server :
$gtm_dist/mumps -run start^httpm
